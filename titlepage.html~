<h2>Annotation manual for the Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical English</h2>

Beatrice Santorini
<br>
(July 2024)

<p> This annotation manual is the latest revision of previous versions
(2004, 2016).  It is heavily indebted to the original document developed
by Ann Taylor and Anthony Kroch for Middle English (Kroch and Taylor 2000)
as well as to the spirit of the guidelines for the Penn Treebank (Marcus,
Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993).

<p> The substance of the guidelines remains largely unchanged, but the
annotation scheme has been streamlined
(see <a href="changes.html">Changes</a>), and the differences between the
annotation of Middle English and (Early) Modern English have been reduced.
<a href="differences.html">Certain differences</a> remain, however, which
are occasioned by the syntactic differences between Middle English and
later stages of the language.  Except where necessary, the examples in the
body of the manual are from (Early) Modern English.

<p>
The guidelines are in force for:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beatrice57/pceec2" target="_blank">Parsed
     Corpus of Early English Correspondence, second edition</a> (PCEEC2)
<li><a href="https://github.com/beatrice57/ellegard-examples-parsed" target="_blank">Parsed
     Ellegård examples</a>
<li>Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical English, 2024 release (information
    for the 2016 release is
    available <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/ppche/ppche-release-2016"
    target="_new">here</a>).
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/beatrice57/ppcme2" target="_blank">Penn Parsed Corpus
        of Middle English, second edition</a>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/beatrice57/ppceme" target="_blank">Penn Parsed Corpus
        of Early Modern English</a>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/beatrice57/ppcmbe2" target="_blank">Penn Parsed Corpus
        of Modern British English, second edition</a>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p> The guidelines were developed for English, but they have been used as
a foundation for annotation guidelines for parsed corpora of various other
Germanic and Romance languages.  The general idea is that the present
guidelines apply as a default except where overruled by
language-particular considerations that are set out in a corpus-particular
manual.

<p>
