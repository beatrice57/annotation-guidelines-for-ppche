<h3>Philosophy and goals</h3>

<ul>

<li>
Our primary goal has been to create an annotation system that facilitates
automated searches, not to give a correct linguistic analysis of each
sentence in our corpora.  As a result, our bracketed structures do not
contain all of the information that a full phrase structure representation
would have.

<p>
<li>
We have tried to plan our system so that at each stage of the annotation,
information is added in a monotonic way.  In particular, we want any
future revisions of the bracketed structures always to add information,
never to change it.  This goal requires us to avoid subjective judgments.
So, for example, we do not attempt to implement the argument-adjunct
distinction with PPs.  In this release, we do, however, attempt to
distinguish between adjectival and verbal passive participles.

<p>
<li>
As many categories as possible should have clear meanings so that unclear
cases can be relegated to a few residual categories.  The price of making
most categories homogeneous is that the residual categories will not be.
In future revisions of the corpora, it may be possible to improve the
analysis of the residual categories.

<p>
<li>
As much as possible, we have avoided making decisions that would be
controversial, whether with regard to text interpretation or to linguistic
theory.  In doubtful cases, we either avoid specifying structure, or we
use default rules to decide the case for search purposes.  An example of
the first strategy concerns VPs.  These are normally not indicated in the
corpus, since VP boundaries are generally indeterminate.  This is clearly
the case in Middle English, which allows scrambling and where the internal
structure of the VP is variable and changing.  But even in modern English,
there are many cases where it is not clear whether some phrase attaches as
a daughter of VP or higher up in the tree.  An example of the second
strategy concerns the attachment of PPs and modifiers more generally.
Whenever it is unclear where such a constituent attaches, we attach it by
default in the highest position that is semantically plausible.

</ul>

<a name="file_formats">
<a name="txt">
<h3>File formats</h3>

Each text in the corpora comes in three different formats, each with a
characteristic filename extension:

<ul>
<li><a href="general-intro.html#txt">text</a> (<tt>.txt</tt>)
<li><a href="general-intro.html#pos">part-of-speech (POS) tagged</a>
    (<tt>.pos</tt>)
<li><a href="general-intro.html#psd">parsed</a> (<tt>.psd</tt>)
<li><a href="general-intro.html#lem">lemmatized</a> (<tt>.lem</tt>)
</ul>

<h4>Text files (<tt>.txt</tt>)</h4>

Text files have the extension <tt>.txt</tt>.  Besides the text, they
contain text-level codes, inherited from the Helsinki Corpus and converted
into HTML-type codes, as described
in <a href="general-intro.html#text_markup">Text markup</a>.  The original page
layout is not retained.  Rather, the text is divided into tokens, which
generally correspond to a main clause together with any subordinate
clauses that it contains.  Each token has a token ID, enclosed in
parentheses, which contains the name of the file, a page reference to the
printed text (possibly including a volume reference), and a running token
number that locates the token within the computer file.  Tokens may also
consist entirely of text-level codes.  Such tokens do not have IDs in the
file, but they are counted by the token counter, which can lead to gaps in
the running token numbers.

<p>
Material that has been split or separated in the course of annotation
(punctuation, contractions, cliticized articles, and so on) remains
separated in the text files in order to simplify searches and tallies.
See <a href="word-tok.html">Word tokenization</a> for details.

<a name="pos">
<h4>Part-of-speech (POS) tagged files (<tt>.pos</tt>)</h4>

Part-of-speech (POS) tagged texts have the extension <tt>.pos</tt>.  They
contain the material in the text files with a POS tag added to each word.
Editorial material such as the text-level codes is given the
tag <tt>CODE</tt>.  Text elements are separated from their POS tags; the
delimiter is the forward slash character (/).

<p>
The text is divided into tokens in the same way as in the text files.

<a name="psd">
<h4>Parsed files (<tt>.psd</tt>)</h4>

Parsed files have the extension <tt>.psd</tt>.  They contain a labeled
bracketing of the text, with the first set of labeled parentheses around
a word repeating the information from the POS-tagged files.  The division
into tokens in the parsed files is the same as in the text and POS files.
Each token is enclosed with its ID in a set of unlabeled parentheses.

<h4>Lemmatized files (<tt>.lem</tt>)</h4>

Lemmatized files have the extension <tt>.lem</tt>.  In addition to the
annotation in the parsed files, each word is associated with a lemma.
See <a href="lemmatization.html">Lemmatization</a> for details.

<a name="text_markup">
<h3>Text markup</h3>

In general, it has not been possible to retain the markup conventions of
the Helsinki Corpus in their original form because of conflicts with the
annotation system.  The major changes made are as follows:

<ul>
<li> The representation of the text as printed on the page is not
retained.  The text is presented in tokens, as just described
in <a href="general-intro.html#file_formats">File formats</a>, rather than line by
line.

<p>
<li>All text-level codes in the text have been changed to HTML-type codes
or omitted as follows:

<p>
<b>Editor comments</b> are either omitted or enclosed in
<tt>{ED:...}</tt>.  Comments added by Helsinki or Penn are enclosed in
<tt>{COM:...}</tt>.
