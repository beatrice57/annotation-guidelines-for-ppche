<p> The annotation uses a limited tree representation in the form of
labeled parentheses.  All open parentheses have an associated label,
either a part-of-speech (POS) label for words (<tt>N</tt>, <tt>Adj</tt>,
etc.) or a phrase label for larger constituents (<tt>NP, ADJP,</tt> etc.).
We use the terms 'label' and 'tag' interchangeably.  Every terminal node
is associated with a POS label, but phrase labels are not included in
every case where a fully labeled tree would require them.  Intermediate
projections in the sense of X' theory (N', ADJ', etc.) are not generally
included in our representations.  By comparison to trees in current
syntactic theory, the trees in our corpora are flat, and they are not
required to be binary-branching.

<p> The partial representation of phrase structure just described is not
intended to make a theoretical statement, but is adopted for practical
reasons.  Certain phrases are generally omitted in the annotation scheme
because their boundaries are too difficult to define.  The prime example
is VP.  The problematic character of VP is particularly obvious in early
Middle English, where the order of the verb and its syntactic dependents
is in flux (at least on the surface).  But even in Present-Day English,
the attachment site of verbal adjuncts is systematically ambiguous between
low attachment within VP and high attachment at the clause level.  Other
categories and distinctions, such as including an NP level within DP, are
omitted because the cost of including them outweighs their usefulness.
Intermediate projections are omitted for both reasons.  In no case should
the lack of any particular phrase label be taken to imply that earlier
forms of English failed to include the corresponding syntactic category.
The trees in the corpora are simply underspecified.

<p> The examples in this section of the manual are constructed examples
from Modern English so as to be maximally accessible.  In the remainder of
the manual, we also include examples from the corpora.  The examples are
mostly from late Middle English and (Early) Modern English; examples from
early Middle English are included when they are necessary to make a
linguistic point.

<a name="general_principles">
<h3>General principles</h3>

As just mentioned, the structures in our corpora generally include neither
VP nor intermediate projections.  As a result, IP immediately dominates
all verbs, as in the following structure:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
( (IP-MAT (NP-SBJ (NPR Mary))
          (HVP has)
          (BEN been)
          (VAG meaning)
          (IP-INF (TO to)
                  (VB go))
          (PP (P for)
	      (NP (D a) (N week)))
	  (PUNC .)))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="dash_tags">
<h4>Dash tags</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Dash tags indicate syntactic subcategory or function.  Basic labels
indicate a constituent's category (NP, PP, ADJP, etc.).  Additional labels
(so-called dash tags or extended tags), which are separated from the
category label by a hyphen, indicate subcategory or function.  More than
one dash tag is possible:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
NP-SBJ         subject NP

ADJP-SPR       secondary predicate ADJP

PP-PRN         parenthetical PP

IP-INF-PRP     purpose infinitive

NP-SBJ-RSP     resumptive subject NP
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<li>
All clause labels (IP, CP) carry a dash tag.  See
<a href="syn-intro.html#internal_structure_of_clauses">Internal structure of
clauses</a> for further basic information and
<a href="syn-sub.html">Types of subordinate clauses</a> for detailed
discussion.

<p>
<li>
All NP daughters of IP carry a dash tag.  Bare NPs are restricted to below
the IP level.

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
( (IP-MAT (NP-TMP (N Yesterday))				&larr; temporal NP
          (NP-SBJ (NPR Mary))		 	  	        &larr; subject
          (VBD told)
          (NP-OB2 (NPR Jane))				        &larr; indirect object
          (CP-THT (C that)
                  (IP-SUB (NP-SBJ (PRO she))
                          (VBD studied)
                          (NP-MSR (QP (ADVR too) (Q much)))	&larr; measure NP
                          (PP (P during)
			      (NP (D the) (N weekend)))))       &larr; no dash tag
	  (PUNC .)))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<li>
AdvP daughters of IP are marked for certain semantic functions
(directional, locative, and temporal).  Other semnatic functions are
unmarked.

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
( (IP-MAT (NP-SBJ (NPR Mary))
          (ADVP (ADV happily))
          (VBD put)
          (NP-OB1 (D the) (N book))
          (ADVP-LOC (ADV there))
	  (ADVP-TMP (ADV+WARD afterward))
	  (PUNC .)))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<li>
PPs are generally not marked for function.

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
( (IP-MAT (NP-SBJ (NPR Mary))
          (VBD put)
          (NP-OB1 (D the) (N book))
          (PP (P on)
              (NP (D the) (N table)))
          (PP (P on)
              (NP (NPR Saturday)))
	  (PUNC .)))
</pre>
</blockquote>

</ul>

<a name="structural_principles">
<h4>Structural principles</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Daughters of IP are generally phrases.  However, IP can immediately
dominate word-level constituents, as illustrated in the following example:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
( (IP-MAT (CONJ But)			      &larr; sentential conjunction
	  (INTJ alas)			      &larr; single-word interjection
	  (, ,)
          (NP-SBJ (PRO we))
	  (MD will)			      &larr; modal
	  (NEG not)			      &larr; negation
	  (Q all)			      &larr; floated quantifier
          (VB end)			      &larr; verb
          (RP up))			      &larr; particle
	  (PP (P with)
	      (NP (PRO$ our) (N favorite)))
	  (. .)))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<li>
The absence of intermediate projections in the trees has several
consequences:

<p>
<ul>
<li>Phrases immediately dominate their head.

<p>
<li>
Specifiers are not structurally distinct from pre-head modifiers.

<p>
<li>
Adjuncts are not structurally distinct from complements, though the
distinction may be encoded by dash tags.

</ul>

<a name="high_attachment">
<p>
<li>
If the attachment level of a constituent is ambiguous or difficult to
determine, the default, as in the Penn Treebank, is to attach as high
as is plausible in context.

<a name="internal_structure_of_phrases">
<h3>Internal structure of phrases</h3>

The internal structure of all nonclausal phrases is fundamentally similar.

<p>
<ul>
<li>Where possible, heads and phrases stand in a one-to-one relation.
Empty heads are possible, though not always explicitly.  In potential
elision contexts, it can be difficult to determine whether the phrase
contains an overt head; such cases are discussed in appropriate detail
in <a href="syn-phrase.html" target="mainframe">Internal structure of
phrases</a>.

<p>
<li>
By convention, single-word modifiers do not project a phrase if they
precede the head being modified.

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
(NP (Q many)	                                        &larr; no QP
    (ADJ happy)                                         &larr; no ADJP
    (NS children)
    (PP (P on)
        (NP (D the) (ADJ overcrowded) (N beach))))

(NP (ADJP (ADJ happy) (CONJ and) (ADJ excited))		&larr; ADJP
    (NS children))

(NP (Q many)				                &larr; no QP
    (ADJP (ADV very) (ADJ happy))	                &larr; ADJP
    (NS children))

(NP (QP (ADV very) (Q many))		                &larr; QP
    (ADJ happy) 	                                &larr; no ADJP
    (NS children))

(ADJP (ADV very) (ADJ happy))	                        &larr; no ADVP

(PP (ADV right)			                        &larr; no ADVP
    (P up)
    (NP (D the) (N street)))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="postmod">
<p>
<li>
However, again by convention, post-head modifiers do project phrases even
when they consist of just a single word.

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
(NP (ADJ various)                           &larr; no ADJP for either adjective
    (ADJ black)
    (NS cats)))

(NP (ADJ black)
    (NS cats)
    (ADJP (ADJ galore)))                    &larr; ADJP for post-head modifier

(NP (ADJR enough)                           &larr; no ADJP
    (N food))

(ADJP (ADJ fast)
      (ADVP (ADVR enough))                  &larr; ADVP for post-head modifier
</pre>
</blockquote>

</ul>

<a name="internal_structure_of_clauses">
<h3>Internal structure of clauses</h3>

<a name="ip">
<h4>IP</h4>

Various aspects of the internal structure of IPs have already been noted.
IPs generally have subjects.  If the subject is not overt,
an <a href="syn-empty.html#empty_subj">empty subject</a> is added.

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
( (IP-MAT (NP-SBJ (PRO They))             &larr; overt subject
          (VBD came)
          (PP (P at)
              (NP (NUM six)))
	  (PUNC ,)))

( (IP-MAT (CONJ and)
          (NP-SBJ *con*)                  &larr; empty subject

          (PP (P at)
              (NP (NUM eight)))
	  (PUNC .)))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> But subjects are not obligatory in imperatives
or <a href="syn-sub.html#ip-inf">infinitives</a>.

<a name="non-wh_cp">
<h4>Non-wh CP</h4>

THAT clauses (<tt>CP-THT</tt>), degree complements (<tt>CP-DEG</tt>), and
certain adverbial clauses (<tt>CP-ADV</tt>) have the following basic
structure:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
(CP (C that / 0)
    (IP ...))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> The complementizer position is always included; when not filled by
an overt complementizer, it contains <tt>0</tt> (zero).

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
( (IP-MAT (NP-SBJ (PRO We))
          (VBD know)    
          (CP-THT (C that / 0)
                  (IP-SUB (NP-SBJ (PRO you))
			  (VBP like)
			  (NP-OB1 (NS vegetables))))
	  (PUNC .)))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="wh_cp">
<h4>Wh- CP</h4>

All other types of CP contain both a wh- position and a complementizer
position.  The schematic struture is as follows, where "WXP" ranges over
wh- phrases:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
(CP (WXP ...)
    (C that / 0)
    (IP ...))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> Both positions can be overtly filled, which was common in Middle
English.  Empty wh- positions and empty complementizers are both indicated
by <tt>0</tt> (zero).  The wh- phrase is coindexed with a trace of the
same category within the IP.  See <a href="syn-empty.html#wh-trace">Wh-
trace</a> for details,
particularly <a href="syn-empty.html#position_of_trace">Position of
traces</a> for the counterintuitive of the trace in IP-initial position.
