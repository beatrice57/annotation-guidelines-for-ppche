<h3>Dimension adjectives</h3>

<p>
As is well known, certain adjectives are <b>gradable</b>; that is, the
properties referred to by the adjectives characterize entities that can
exhibit those properties to a greater or lesser extent or degree.  In
what follows, we refer to the gradable properties as <b>dimensions</b>
and to the adjectives expressing them as <b>dimension adjectives</b>.
Dimension adjectives can be modified, with the resulting expression
corresponding to some point on a scale.  The scale represents the
dimension, and the modifier specifies the point.

<blockquote>
<pre>
( (ADJP (ADV barely / hardly / unusually / unexpectedly / very)
	(ADJ warm)))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<b>Note:</b> The following discussion focuses on adjectives, but extends
in a straightforward way to gradable adverbs.

<a name="deg_constructions">
<h3>Degree constructions</h3>

<p> The degree to which an entity exhibits a dimension may be correlated
with some other property.  In particular, the correlating property might
hold beyond (above or below) a certain threshold point for its
dimension.  This type of correlation is highlighted by a type of
modifier that we will call a <b>degree head</b>; we will refer to the
phrase expressing the correlating property as the <b>degree
complement.</b> Our annotation treats degree heads as heads of modifiers
on a par with other modifiers of dimension adjectives.  They are tagged
as ordinary adverbs (<tt>ADV</tt>) if they end in <i>-ly</i> and as
comparative adverbs (<tt>ADVR</tt>) otherwise; in both cases, they
project <tt>ADVP</tt> if necessary.  Even though the degree complement
depends on the degree head (not on the dimension adjective), the
annotation represents all three expressions as sisters.

<blockquote>

<p> The degree complement may be absent in the syntax.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p> In connection with the degree head SO, the dimension adjective can
be absent in the syntax.  In these cases, SO is tagged as <tt>P</tt>
rather than <tt>ADVR</tt>.  See <a href="words.html#so_as">SO AS (THAT),
SO AS TO</a> for examples and <a href="words.html#so_that">SO (THAT)</a>

<a name="modification_of_modifiers">
<h4>Modification of modifiers</h4>

<p> Degree modifiers may themselves may be modified.  By convention,
extraposition from positions not available in the surface syntax is not
annotated.

<blockquote>

( (ADJP (ADVP (Q all) (ADVR too))
	(ADJ hot)))

<a name="measure_modification">
<h4>Measure modification</h4>

<p> So far, we have discussed qualitative degree modifiers.  A subset of
dimension adjectives, given below, additionally allows quantitative, or
measure, modification.

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Spatial:   DEEP, DISTANT, <a href="words.html#far">FAR</a>, HIGH, LONG, TALL, WIDE

Temporal:  EARLY, LATE, OLD

Other:     <a href="words.html#worth">WORTH</a>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> This type of modification corresponds to the everyday procedure of
measuring some length using a ruler.  The extent to which an entity
exhibits the dimension under discussion is defined in terms of an
interval bounded by two endpoints associated with the entity.  The
interval is mapped onto an interval on the scale associated with the
dimension (the ruler).  The scale in question has properties that go
beyond scales associated with qualitative modification.  In particular,
it has an origin or zero point, and it is divided into equal units.  In
other words, the scale is isomorphic to the natural numbers.  The zero
point on the scale is aligned with one of the endpoints on the entity,
and the point on the scale corresponding to the other endpoint on the
entity yields a numerical measure of the degree to which the entity
exhibits the dimension.  The following expressions spell out the various
parameters just introduced, apart from the zero point on the scale,
which is constant and hence never expressed.

<blockquote>
<pre>
( (ADJP (NP-MSR (NUM three)			&larr; second endpoint on scale
		(NS feet))			&larr; unit of measurement
	(ADJ wide)				&larr; dimension adjective
	(PP (P from)
	    (NP (D the)				&larr; first endpoint on entity
		(ADJ left)
		(N edge)))
	(PP (P to)
	    (NP (D the)				&larr; second endpoint on entity
		(ADJ right)))))

( (ADJP (NP-MSR (NUM three)			&larr; second endpoint on scale
		(NS years))			&larr; unit of measurement
		(ADJ old)			&larr; dimension adjective
		(PP (P from)
		    (NP (N birth)))		&larr; first endpoint on entity
		(PP (P to)
		    (NP (D the)			&larr; second endpoint on entity
			(ADJ present)
			(N moment))))))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> The interval between the endpoints can be further described (say, in
terms of its properties as a path).

<blockquote>
<pre>
( (ADJP (NP-MSR (NUM twenty)			&larr; second endpoint on scale
		(NS miles))			&larr; unit of measurement
	(ADJ distant)				&larr; dimension adjective
	(PP (P from)
	    (NP (D the)				&larr; first endpoint on entity
		(N center)
		(PP (P of)
		    (NP (N town)))))
	(PP (P to)
	    (ADVP (ADV here)))			&larr; second endpoint on entity
	(PP (P by)				&larr; path descriptor
	    (NP (ADJ winding)
		(NS roads)))))

( (ADJP (NP-MSR (NUM thirty-six)		&larr; second endpoint on scale
		(NS inches))			&larr; unit of measurement
	(ADJ long)				&larr; dimension
	(PP (P in)				&larr; path descriptor
	    (NP (N circumference)))))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> In ordinary usage, various parameters, including the dimension itself, are
often not overtly expressed.  In order to clarify the structure, silent heads of
measure phrases and silent dimension adjectives may be added to the annotation.
Implicit endpoints on the entity are not annotated, however.
  
<blockquote>
<pre>
( (ADJP (NP-MSR (NUM three)
		(NS feet))
	(ADJ 0)				&larr; implicit dimension (WIDE)
	(PP (P from)			&larr; implicit second endpoint on entity

   			    (NS 0))	&larr; implicit unit (YEARS)
		    (ADJ 0)))		&larr; implicit dimension (OLD)
	  (PUNC .)))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="dimension_n">
<h4>Dimension noun</h4>

<p> Dimensions can also be expressed by nominal heads.  In such cases,
the entire construction is annotated as a noun phrase, with a dash tag
appropriate to the syntactic context.  The syntactic head of the entire
NP construction is not usually the dimension noun.

<blockquote>
<pre>
( (NP (NUM thirty-six)
      (NS years)		&larr; head of NP =/= dimension head
      (PP (P of)
	  (NP (N age)))))	&larr; dimension (OLD) expressed, but not as ADJ

( (PP (P from)
      (NP (NUM thirty-six)
	  (NS years)
	  (PP (P of)
	      (NP (N age))))))

( (IP-MAT (NP-SBJ (PRO It))
	  (BEP is)
          (NP-PRD (NUM thirty-six)
    	          (NS inches)			&larr; head of NP =/= dimension head

	     	      (NP (N length))))		&larr; dimension (LONG) expressed, but not as ADJ
	  (PUNC .)))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> The integration of scalar constructions into larger constituents
follows general principles.

<blockquote>
<pre>
( (NP (D a)
      (N child)

<a name="comp_constructions">
<h3>Comparative constructions</h3>

Comparative constructions are similar to degree constructions.  Instead
of a pure degree head associated with a degree complement, they contain
a comparative degree head associated with a standard of comparison.
Comparative clauses (<tt>CP-CMP</tt>)
are <a href="syn-intro.html#wh_cp">Wh- CP</a>.  The wh- antecedent is
silent; its syntactic category is generally the wh- phrase counterpart
to the syntactic category of the dimension of comparison (but see below
for <a href="syn-sub.html#cp-cmp_subdeletion">comparative subdeletion</a>).

<blockquote>
<pre>

<p> In synthetic comparatives, the degree head and the dimension of
comparison are expressed in a single word.

<p> As with degree constructions, the complement of the comparative
degree head can be silent in the syntax.

<blockquote>
<pre>

</blockquote>

<p> As expected, the degree head can be modified.  Any modifiers of AS
are generally not set off with AS as a pharse.

<blockquote>
