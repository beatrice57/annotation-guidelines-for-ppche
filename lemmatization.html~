<a name="lemma-authority">
<h3>Lemma authority</h3>

Our lemma authority is the Oxford English Dictionary (OED).

<a name="lemma-format">
<h3>Lemma format</h3>

The delimiter between a word and its lemma is the pound sign (#), which
does not otherwise appear in the corpora.

<p>
Schematically:

<blockquote> <pre>
(POS-tag word#lemma))
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> The OED is not our authority for POS tags.

<blockquote> <pre>
(<font color="red">D</font> a#a_<font color="red">adj</font>))

(<font color="red">P</font> while#while_<font color="red">adv</font>))
</pre> </blockquote>

<a name="lemma-type">
<h3>Lemma type</h3>

There are four lemma types:

<ul>
<li><a href="ordinary-lemma">ordinary</a>
<li><a href="derived-lemma">derived</a>
<li><a href="compound-lemma">compound</a>
<li><a href="no-lemma">none</a>
</ul>

<a name="ordinary-lemma">
<h4>Ordinary lemma</h4>

The word has its own OED headword.

<p>
Schematically:

<blockquote> <pre>
(POS-tag word#OED_headword))
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
Example:

<blockquote> <pre>
(N cat#cat_n))
</pre> </blockquote>

<a name="derived-lemma">
<h4>Derived lemma</h4>

The word has no OED headword of its own, but is listed under some other
headword.

<p>
Schematically:

<blockquote> <pre>
(POS-tag word#SEE_OED_headword)
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
Example:

<blockquote> <pre>
(ADJ many-legged#SEE_many_adj)

(N palmer-worm#SEE_palmer_n1)
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
Derived lemmas are also assigned if:

<ul> 
<li>the word contains an element listed in the OED as a so-called
    combining form (productive affix).

<blockquote> <pre>
(ADJ ill-suited#SEE_ill_combform)
</pre> </blockquote>

<li>the word is a parasynthetic compound.  Such words are formed by both
    compounding and derivation, with the derivational morpheme
    (here, <i>-ed</i>) taking scope over an otherwise unattested
    compound (here, <i>hazel-hair</i>).

<blockquote> <pre>
(ADJ hazel-haired#SEE_hazel_n)
</pre> </blockquote>
</ul>

<p> In assigning a derived lemma in these last two cases, the lemma of
the first constituent takes precedence over later ones.  In other words,
<i>ill-suited</i> and <i>hazel-haired</i> get their lemmas from
<i>ill-</i> and <i>hazel</i> rather than from <i>suited</i> and
<i>haired</i>.

<a name="compound-lemma">
<h4>Compound lemma</h4>

The word has no OED headword of its own and is not a candidate for the
derived lemma type, but at least one constituents does have an OED
headword.

<blockquote> <pre>
(N coral-rock#cNA)
</pre> </blockquote>

<a name="no-lemma">
<h4>No lemma</h4>

The word cannot be associated with an OED headword at all, either
directly or indirectly.  This is true by definition of words tagged
as <tt>FW</tt> (foreign word).

<p>
Schematically:

<blockquote> <pre>
(POS-tag word#NA)
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
Example:

<blockquote> <pre>
(FW Beutelratte#NA)
</pre> </blockquote>

</ul>

<a name="general-principles">
<h3>General principles</h3>

<p>
The two main principles for our lemmatization are:

<ul>
<li>to associate the word with the first possible lemma type
    (ordinary &gt; derived &gt; compound &gt; NA), and
<li>to respect the original orthography of the text 
</ul>

<p>
Cases (especially in earlier stages of English) that are (in principle)
ambiguous between a phrasal and a compound word analysis are treated as
spelled.

<blockquote> <pre>
(NP (ADJ gentle#gentle_adj)
    (N man#man_n1))

(NP (N gentleman#gentleman_n))
</pre> </blockquote>

<p> We attempt to resolve conflicts between the two principles by
adjusting orthographic word boundaries - that is, by joining or
splitting orthographic words.

<p> Joining is indicated by "_" (underscore).  It occurs frequently in
connection with abbreviations and expressions from Latin (<i>a. m.,</i>
<i>P. S.,</i> <i>p. m.,</i> <i>per annum,</i> <i>per cent,</i> and the
like).  The rationale for joining is that the joined expression gets an
ordinary lemma, which outranks any NAs of the unjoined expression.

<blockquote> <pre>
(ADVP (ADV per_Annum#per-annum_adv))			&larr; this way

(PP (P per#per_prep)					&larr; not this way
    (NP (FW Annum#NA)))
</pre> </blockquote>

<p> Splitting is indicated by trailing and leading "@" (at sign).  By
default, words are split after hyphens (rather than before).  The
rationale for splitting is that the ordinary lemmas of the split
expression outrank the NA of the unsplit expression.

<blockquote> <pre>
(ADJP (Q little-@#little_adj)                           &larr; this way
      (ADJ @compounded#compounded_adj))

(ADJP (ADJ little-compounded#NA))			&larr; not this way
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Splitting is not carried out consistently.  In practice, it
is restricted to prenominal participial adjectives as in the above
example.

<a name="special-cases">
<h3>Special cases</h3>

By convention, certain words are not associated with a lemma even when
they have an OED headword.

<a name="proper-nouns">
<h4>Proper nouns (<tt>NPR</tt> and variants)</h4>

<p>The OED does not list proper nouns when used as names.  For
   uniformity, we apply this convention to all instances of words tagged
   with the <tt>NPR</tt> tag and its variants, including where these
   words are used as modifiers and the like.

<p>Proper nouns used as common nouns are treated in the ordinary way if
   they have an OED headword.

<blockquote> <pre>
(NP (NPR Elizabeth#NA))

(NP (D an#a_adj) (N Elizabeth#elizabeth_n)		&larr; coin with likeness of Elizabeth I
</pre> </blockquote>

<a name="numbers">
<h4>Numbers</h4>

Cardinal numbers (<tt>NUM</tt>), regardless of representation (as words,
Arabic or Roman numerals, scientific notation) and including any
instances of AND, are joined.

<blockquote> <pre>
(NUM twenty_one)
(NUM one_and_twenty)
(NUM xx_ij)
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
Compounds with DOZEN and SCORE count as number words.

<blockquote> <pre>
(NUM half-a-dozen)
(NUM two_dozen)
(NUM threescore)
(NUM three_score_and_fifteen)
</pre> </blockquote>

<p> By convention, we lemmatize only basic number words, again
independently of representation.  We define the basic number words as
follows:

<ul>
<li>the number words from 0 to 19
<li>the tens or <i>-ty</i> words from 20 to 100
<li>bare "basic" powers of ten (HUNDRED, THOUSAND, MILLION).  In principle,
    BILLION, TRILLION, etc. belong here, but they do not occur in the
    corpora.
</ul>

<blockquote> <pre>
(NUM one#one)
(NUM 2#two)
(NUM xix#nineteen)

(NUM xx#twenty)

(NUM 100#hundred)
</pre> </blockquote>

<p> All other numbers, including ones with initial A_ for ONE, are not lemmatized.

<blockquote> <pre>
(NUM twenty_two#NA)
(NUM two_and_twenty#NA)
(NUM 22#NA)
(NUM xx_ij#NA)

(NUM one-hundred#NA)
(NUM a_hundred#NA)
(NUM two_hundred#NA)
(NUM 200#NA)
(NUM 3,000#NA)

(NUM half-a-dozen#NA)
(NUM two_dozen#NA)
(NUM threescore#NA)
(NUM three_score_and_fifteen#NA)
</pre> </blockquote>

</ul>

Ordinal numbers (<tt>ADJ</tt>) are joined like cardinal numbers.

<blockquote> <pre>
(ADJ twenty-first)
(ADJ twenty_first)
(ADJ one_and_twentieth)
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
Only the suppletive forms FIRST, SECOND, and THIRD are lemmatized.
Higher ordinal numbers have no lemma.

<blockquote> <pre>
(ADJ first#first_adj)
(ADJ 2nd#second_adj)

(ADJ twenty-first#NA)
</pre> </blockquote>

<p> Ordinal adverbs (FIRSTLY, SECONDLY, THIRDLY, and so on) are treated
analogously.

<blockquote> <pre>
(ADV Firstlie=#firstly_adv)
(ADV 2nd=ly=#secondly_adv)
(ADV sixthly#NA)
</pre> </blockquote>

<a name="letters-and-symbols">
<h4>Letters and symbols</h4>

Letters of the alphabet, symbols in diagrams, and the like are not lemmatized.

<blockquote> <pre>
(NP (D the#the_adj) (N letter#letter_n1)
    (NP-PRN (N A#NA)))

(NP (D the_adj) (N line_n2)
    (NP-PRN (N ab#NA)))
</pre> </blockquote>
