<h3>Prolegomena</h3>

<blockquote>

Ideally, we would like to use the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) as our
lemma authority for lemmatizing our parsed corpora of (Early) Modern
English.  But the OED is under copyright, so it is not straightforward
to do this.  Therefore, we have instead chosen
the <a href="https://archive.org/details/oed01arch/page/522/mode/2up">New
English Dictionary</a> (NED) as our lemma authority, which is entirely
in the public domain.  It is a forerunner of the current edition of the
OED and hence an excellent second-best resource.

<p>
NED-based lemmatized versions of the following corpora exist and are
available via the following links.

<p>
<ul>
<li>Parsed Corpus of Early English Correspondence, second edition</a>
    (PCEEC2), available directly
    at <a href="https://github.com/beatrice57/pceec2"
    target="_new">github</a>.

<li>Penn Parsed Corpus of Early Modern English (PPCEME), to be available
    as of October 2025 via a <a href="">patch at github</a>.  The patch
    requires a copy of the release version of the parsed files.

<li>Penn Parsed Corpus of Modern British English (PPCMBE2), to be available 
    as of October 2025 via a <a href="">patch at github</a>.  The patch
    requires a copy of the release version of the parsed files.
</ul>

<p>
Since these are first releases of lemmatized versions, it is especially
important to report errors.  This ensures that the annotation improves
over time.  Please report errors to beatrice DOT santorini AT gmail DOT
com.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> A (partially) lemmatized version of the Penn Parsed Corpus
of Middle English (PPCME2) can be produced by the
<a href="http://basics-toolkit.spdns.org/" target="_new">BASICS
lemmatizer</a>.  Contact: Prof. Carola Trips, carola DOT trips AT

<h3>Lemma authority</h3>

<blockquote>
For the reasons just stated, our lemma authority is the New English
Dictionary (NED).  NED lemmas are generally associated with one or more
parts of speech, and homonyms with the same part of speech are
distinguished by trailing Arabic numerals.  We have streamlined this
system as follows.

<a name="lemma-format">
<h3>Lemma format</h3>

<blockquote>

The delimiter between a word and its lemma is the pound sign or hash
mark (#).

<p>
<table border cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td><img src="caution.GIF">
<td>This character was chosen as delimiter because it does not otherwise
appear in the corpora.  It has the drawback of having special
significance for various shells and programs.  In such cases, the
workaround is to replace '#' by some otherwise unattested expression
like "XHASHX" or the like.

<a name="lemma-type">
<h3>Lemma type</h3>

<blockquote>

There are four lemma types:

<ul>
<li><a href="ordinary-lemma">ordinary</a> (indicated by the relevant
    headword)
<li><a href="derived-lemma">derived</a> (indicated by the first relevant
    headword, preceded by "SEE_")
<li><a href="compound-lemma">compound</a> (indicated by "cNA")
<li><a href="no-lemma">none</a> (indicated by "NA")
</ul>

<a name="ordinary-lemma">
<h4>Ordinary lemma</h4>

<p>
<blockquote>
The word has a headword of its own.

<p>
<table border cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<th align=left>Schema
<th align=left>Example(s)
<tr>
<td>(POS-tag word#headword)
<td>(N cabbage#cabbage_n1)
</table>

</blockquote>

<a name="derived-lemma">
<h4>Derived lemma</h4>

<blockquote>
Derived lemmas are assigned when:

<ul> 
<li>the word has no headword of its own, but is listed under some other
    headword.
<li>the word contains a constituent listed in the lemma authority as an
    affix or "combining form".
<li>the word is a "parasynthetic compound" (for
    instance, <i>hazel-haired</i>).  Such words are formed by both
    compounding and derivation, with a derivational morpheme
    like <i>-ed</i> taking scope over an otherwise unattested compound
    like <i>hazel-hair</i>.
</ul>

<p> In the last two cases, the lemma of first constituent takes
precedence over later ones in determining the lemma of the whole word.
For instance, in <i>protonephron</i> and <i>hazel-haired</i> get their
lemmas from <i>proto-</i> and <i>hazel</i> rather than
from <i>nephron</i> and <i>haired</i>.

<p>
<table border cellpadding=5>

<th align=left>Example(s)
<tr>
<td>(POS-tag word#SEE_headword)
<td>
(ADJ plundered#SEE_plunder_v2)
<br>
(N protonephron#SEE_proto_combform)
<br>
(ADJ hazel-haired#SEE_hazel_n)
</table>

</blockquote>

<a name="compound-lemma">
<h4>Compound lemma</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>
The word has no headword of its own nor does it meet the requirements
for derived lemmas.  But at least one constituent has a headword.

<p>
<table border cellpadding=5>
<tr>

<a name="no-lemma">
<h4>No lemma</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>
The word is not associated with headword, either directly or indirectly.
This is true by definition of words tagged as <tt>FW</tt> (foreign
word).

<p>

<a name="general-principles">
<h3>General principles</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>
The two main principles for our lemmatization are:

<ul>
<li>to respect the original orthography of the text, and
<li>to associate each word with the first possible lemma type (ordinary
    &gt; derived &gt; compound &gt; NA)
</ul>

<p>
These principles, applied in order, give the following results when
applied to cases (especially in earlier stages of English) that are (in
principle) ambiguous between phrases and compound words.

<blockquote> <pre>
(NP (ADJ gentle#gentle_adj)
    (N man#man_n1))

(NP (N gentleman#gentleman_n))
</pre> </blockquote>

<p> In certain cases, we modify orthographic boundaries in the text.
Joining is indicated by "_" (underscore).  It is frequent in connection
with nativized abbreviations and expressions from Latin
(<i>a. m.,</i> <i>P. S.,</i> <i>p. m.,</i> <i>per cent.,</i> and the
like).

<blockquote><pre>
(ADVP (ADV a._m.#a.m._adv))				&larr; this way
(LATIN (FW a.#NA) (FW m.#NA))				&larr; not this way

(ADVP (ADV per_cent.#per_cent_adv))			&larr; this way
(PP (P per#per_prep)					&larr; not this way
    (NP (N cent.#n1)))
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
Splitting is indicated by trailing and leading "@" (at sign).  By
default, words are split after hyphens (rather than before).

<blockquote> <pre>
(ADJP (Q little-@#little_adj)                           &larr; this way
      (ADJ @compounded#compounded_adj))

(ADJP (ADJ little-compounded#NA))			&larr; not this way
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
Our rationale for adjusting orthographic word boundaries when we do is
that it tends to produce items with lemmas over ones with NA.  Due to
the number and complexity of relevant cases, joining and splitting are
difficult to apply consistently.  We have done our best to do so for
certain individual items and for certain recurring subtypes such as
complex prenominal participial adjectives like <i>little-compounded</i>.

</blockquote>

<a name="special-cases">
<h3>Special cases</h3>

<blockquote>

By convention, certain words are not associated with a lemma even when
they could be assigned one.

<a name="proper-nouns">
<h4>Proper nouns (<tt>NPR</tt> and variants)</h4>

<p>The NED does not list proper nouns when used as names.  For
   uniformity, we apply this convention to all instances of words tagged
   with the <tt>NPR</tt> tag and its variants, including where these
   words are used as modifiers and the like.

<p>When used as common nouns, proper nouns are lemmatized according to
   the above rules.

<blockquote> <pre>
(NP (NPR Elizabeth#NA))

(NP (D an#a_adj) (N Elizabeth#elizabeth_n))		&larr; coin with likeness of Elizabeth I
</pre> </blockquote>

<a name="numbers">
<h4>Numbers</h4>

Cardinal numbers (<tt>NUM</tt>), regardless of representation (as words,
Arabic or Roman numerals, scientific notation) and including any
instances of AND, are joined.

<blockquote> <pre>
(NUM twenty_one)
(NUM one_and_twenty)
(NUM xx_ij)
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
Compounds with DOZEN and SCORE count as number words.

<blockquote> <pre>
(NUM half-a-dozen)
(NUM two_dozen)
(NUM threescore)
(NUM three_score_and_fifteen)
</pre> </blockquote>

<p> By convention, we lemmatize only basic number words, again
independently of representation.  We define the basic number words as
follows:

<ul>
<li>the number words from 0 to 19
<li>the tens or <i>-ty</i> words from 20 to 90
</ul>

<blockquote> <pre>
(NUM one#one_adj)
(NUM 2#two_adj)
(NUM xix#nineteen_adj)

(NUM twenty#twenty_adj)
(NUM .L.#fifty_adj)
</pre> </blockquote>

<p> All other numbers, including ones with initial A_ for ONE, are not
lemmatized.

<blockquote> <pre>
(NUM twenty_two#NA)
(NUM two_and_twenty#NA)
(NUM 22#NA)
(NUM xx_ij#NA)

(NUM one-hundred#NA)
(NUM a_hundred#NA)
(NUM two_hundred#NA)
(NUM 200#NA)
(NUM 3,000#NA)
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
"Bare" powers of ten (HUNDRED, THOUSAND, MILLION) - that is, ones not
preceded by some number (including A or ONE) - are tagged as plural
nouns (<tt>NS</tt>), not numerals (<tt>NUM</tt>).  As a result, they do
receive lemmas.  In principle, this also goes for BILLION, TRILLION,
etc., but these do not occur in the corpora.

<blockquote> <pre>
(NS hundreds#hundred_n)
(NS Thowsands#thousand_n)   
</pre> </blockquote>

Ordinal numbers (<tt>ADJ</tt>) are joined like cardinal numbers.

<blockquote> <pre>
(ADJ twenty-first)
(ADJ twenty_first)
(ADJ one_and_twentieth)
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
Only the suppletive forms FIRST, SECOND, and THIRD are lemmatized.
Higher ordinal numbers have no lemma.

<blockquote> <pre>
(ADJ first#first_adj)
(ADJ 2nd#second_adj)

(ADJ sixth#NA)
(ADJ twenty-first#NA)
</pre> </blockquote>

<p> Ordinal adverbs (FIRSTLY, SECONDLY, THIRDLY, and so on) are treated
analogously.

<blockquote> <pre>
(ADV Firstlie#firstly_adv)
(ADV 2nd=ly=#secondly_adv)
(ADV sixthly#NA)
</pre> </blockquote>

<a name="letters-and-symbols">
<h4>Letters and symbols</h4>

Letters of the alphabet, symbols in diagrams, and the like are not lemmatized.

<blockquote> <pre>
(NP (D the#the_adj) (N letter#letter_n1)
    (NP-PRN (N A#NA)))

(NP (D the_adj) (N line_n2)
    (NP-PRN (N ab#NA)))
</pre> </blockquote>

</blockquote>
