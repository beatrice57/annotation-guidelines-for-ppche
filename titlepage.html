<h2>Annotation manual for the Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical English
    and the Parsed Corpus of Early English Correspondence 2</h2>

Beatrice Santorini
<br>
(January 2022)

<p> This annotation manual is the latest revision of previous versions
(2004, 2016).  It is heavily indebted to the original document developed
by Ann Taylor and Anthony Kroch for Middle English (Kroch and Taylor 2000)
as well as to the spirit of the guidelines for the Penn Treebank (Marcus,
Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993).

<p> The substance of the guidelines remains largely unchanged, but the
annotation scheme has been streamlined
(see <a href="changes.html">Changes</a>), and the differences between the
annotation of Middle English and (Early) Modern English have been reduced.
<a href="differences.html">Certain differences</a> remain, however, which
are occasioned by the syntactic differences between Middle English and
later stages of the language.  Except where necessary, the examples in the
body of the manual are from (Early) Modern English.

<p> This version of the manual also contains guidelines
concerning <a href="lemmatization/lemmatization-index.html">lemmatization</a>,
which has been carried out for PPCEME and PPCMBE2 using the Oxford English
Dictionary (OED) as a lemma authority.

<p> The present guidelines are in force for the following corpora:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2020T16"
       target="_blank">Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical English</a>
       (Kroch 2020)
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/ppche/ppche-release-2016/PPCME2-RELEASE-4/"
	target="_blank">Penn-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Middle English</a>,
	second edition (PPCME2) (Kroch and Taylor 2000)
    <li><a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/ppche/ppche-release-2016/PPCEME-RELEASE-3/"
        target="_blank">Penn-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Early Modern English</a>
        (PPCEME)
        (Kroch, Santorini, and Delfs 2004)
    <li><a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/ppche/ppche-release-2016/PPCMBE2-RELEASE-1/"
	target="_blank">Penn Parsed Corpus of Modern British English</a>,
	second edition (PPCMBE2) (Kroch, Santorini, and Diertani 2016)
    </ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beatrice57/pceec2" target="_blank">Parsed
     Corpus of Early English Correspondence, second edition</a> (PCEEC2)
</ul>

<p> The guidelines were developed for English, but they have been used as
a foundation for annotation guidelines for parsed corpora of various other
Germanic and Romance languages.  The general idea is that the present
guidelines apply as a default except where overruled by
language-particular considerations that are set out in a corpus-particular
manual.
