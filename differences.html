<h3>Adverbial NP (<tt>NP-ADV</tt>)</h3>

<a href="syn-const.html#face_to_face">FACE TO FACE</a> and the like have
been assimilated to <a href="syn-const.html#each_in_his_own_way">EACH IN
HIS OWN WAY</a> and the like, with <tt>NP</tt> brackets surrounding the
initial word in both cases.

<a name="cipher">
<h3>Ciphers</h3>

Text used as cipher is tagged as CIPHER in the PCEEC2.  In the other corpora,
such text is tagged with its ordinary part of speech (N, NUM).

<a name="collective_noun">
<h3>Collective noun</h3>

<p> In the PPCME2, collective nouns (FOLK, HORS, PEOPLE, etc.) are tagged
as <tt>N</tt>.  In early texts, before the generalization of plural -S, it
can be quite difficult to distinguish reliably between singular and
plural.  For texts from the Middle English period M1, we have therefore
tried to follow the translation that accompanies the text, or when this is
lacking, a separate translation.  For details, consult the information for
the individual texts.
See <a href="pos.html#noun_singular_collective_or_plural">Singular,
collective, or plural noun</a> for further discussion.

<p> In the later corpora, PEOPLE is tagged as singular (<tt>N</tt>) after
an unambiguously singular determiner (A, THAT, THIS), and as plural
(<tt>NS</tt>) otherwise.

<a name="least">
<a name="less">
<a name="more">
<a name="most">
<a name="much">
<a name="q_as_adj_ppcme2">
<a name="quantifier">
<h3>Comparative or superlative quantifier (LESS, LEAST; MUCH, MORE, MOST)</h3>

In the PPCME2, LESS, LEAST and MUCH, MORE, MOST are generally tagged as
adjectives (<tt>ADJ, ADJR, ADJS</tt>), rather than as quantifiers
(<tt>Q, QR, QS</tt>), under the conditions
described <a href="differences.html#q_as_adj_ppcme2">below</a>.  The
distinction between the adjectival use and the pure quantifier use is
not always easy to make in a consistent way and becomes more difficult
over time.  In the later corpora, these items are therefore uniformly
tagged as quantifiers (<tt>Q, QR, QS</tt>).
See <a href="syn-phrase.html#adjp_head_adjr">Comparative adjective as
head of ADJP</a>
and <a href="syn-phrase.html#adjp_head_adjs">Superlative adjective as
head of ADJP</a> for further discussion.

<p>
The items under discussion are tagged as adjectives:

<p>
<ul>
<li>when following a determiner or possessive and preceding a noun.  This
    includes cases where a noun has clearly been elided, but not
    comparative constructions like SHE LOVED HIM THE LESS or SHE WAS THE
    MORE MERRY (where the quantifier is either followed by nothing or
    something other than a noun).
<li>when used as a predicate (with
a <a href="words.html#copular_verb">copular verb</a> or in
a <a href="syn-sub.html#ip-smc">small clause</a>)
</ul>

<a name="disfluencies">
<h3>Disfluencies</h3>

<a href="syn-disfluencies.html">Disfluencies</a> are indicated only in the
PPCMBE2; in the other corpora, they hardly ever occur.

<a name="do">
<h3>DO</h3>

In Middle English, DO can be ambiguous between a causative
(<a href="syn-sub.html#ecm_or_obj_control">ECM</a>) main verb and a
periphrastic auxiliary.  The default in the PPCME2 is to treat ambiguous
cases as causative except when a causative reading is impossible.
Causative DO dies out in the course of Middle English, and so instances
of DO in the later corpora that could in principle be treated as
ambiguous are instead uniformly treated as periphrastic.

<a name="foreign">
<h3>Foreign text</h3>

In the PPCHE, sequences of foreign words (<TT>FW</TT>) are surrounded by
brackets labeled LATIN or FOREIGN (any language other than Latin).  In the
PCEEC2, such sequences are labeled as FOREIGN uniformly.

<a name="lfd">
<h3>Left dislocation</h3>

In the PPCME2, PPs are annotated as left-dislocated only if the resumptive
element is a matching PP (that is, if the prepositions in the
left-dislocated and resumptive phrases are identical, and if the objects
of the prepositions corefer); there are only a handful of examples.

<h3>NEED(S) and other adverbial genitives</h3>

In the PPCME2, NEED(S) and other
originally <a href="syn-const.html#np-adv_gen">adverbial genitives</a> are
treated as bare nouns (<tt>N</tt>) heading <tt>NP-ADV</tt>.  These forms
die out in the course of Early Modern English.  Where they survive

<h3>Participial clause as complement of verb</h3>

In the PPCME2, participial clauses very rarely function as complements
of verbs, as in <i>I don't mind <u>creating exams</u>, but the worst
part is <u>grading them</u></i>.  As a result, such cases are annotated
as bare <tt>IP-PPL</tt> rather than as <tt>IP-PPL-OB1/PRD</tt>, as in
the later corpora.
See <a href="syn-sub.html#ip-ppl_without_subj">Participial clause

<a name="possessive_clitic">
<h3>Possessive clitic</h3>

In the PCEEC2, the possessive clitic <i>'s</i> is always split off from
its host noun.  In the Penn corpora, this is only true when the clitic
takes scope over a constituent larger than its host.
See <a href="syn-phrase.html#np_mod_poss">Genitive/possessive modifier of
N</a> for details.
