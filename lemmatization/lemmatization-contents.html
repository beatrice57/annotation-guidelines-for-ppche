<h3>Lemmatization guidelines for the PPCHE</h3>

<h4>Hezekiah Bacovin and Beatrice Santorini</h4>

A beta lemmatized version of the PPCEME and PPCMBE2 is complete.  In
principle, the present guidelines extend to the PPCME2, but we have not
lemmatized that corpus (yet).

<a name="structure">
<h4>Structure of lemmatized words</h4>

In a non-lemmatized corpus, the words in the text are represented as
terminal nodes.  These are unique daughters of preterminal nodes
representing the word's POS (= part-of-speech) tag (= morphosyntactic
category).

<blockquote> <pre>
(NS men)
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
In the lemmatized PPCMBE2 corpora, the preterminal nodes have additional
internal structure.  For example:

<blockquote> <pre>
(NS (o men)
    (m (l (h man) (OEDID 113198))))
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
Each POS tag immediately dominates two nodes:

<ul>
<li><a href="lemmatization-contents.html#ortho">ORTHO</a> (or "o") represents the word as it
appears in the text.
<li><a href="lemmatization-contents.html#metaword">METAWORD</a> (or "m") dominates other
information about the word, generally an OED headword (= dictionary
entry) and that headword's ID number.
</ul>

<a name="ortho">
<h4>ORTHO</h4>

ORTHO (or "o") dominates overt phonological material as it appears in
the text.  Information about traces and other silent categories, which
are part of the annotated corpus but not the original text, are
represented under <a href="lemmatization-contents.html#metaword">METAWORD</a>.

<a name="metaword">
<h4>METAWORD</h4>

METAWORD (or "m") dominates other information about the word under three
possible daughters.  One daughter, LEMMA, is obligatorily present.  The
other two, ALT-ORTHO and PLUSTAG, are optional.
<ul>
<li><a href="lemmatization-contents.html#alt-ortho">ALT-ORTHO</a> (optional)
<li><a href="lemmatization-contents.html#lemma">LEMMA</a>
<li><a href="lemmatization-contents.html#plustag">PLUSTAG</a> (optional)
</ul>

<p>
<a name="alt-ortho">
<h4>ALT-ORTHO</h4>

ALT-ORTHO (or "a") dominates phonologically null material (including,
but not limited to, traces).  It is incompatible with LEMMA or PLUSTAG.
For instance, compare the overt complementizer <i>that</i> with its
silent counterpart:

<blockquote> <pre>
(C (o that)
   (m (l (h that) (OEDID 200179))))

(C (m (a 0)))
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
Under the current syntactic annotation guidelines, most silent
categories are not dominated by POS tags, but directly by phrasal
categories.  In such cases, METAWORD and ALT-ORTHO are associated with
the relevant phrasal category.

<blockquote> <pre>
(NP (m (a *con*)))           &larr; silent conjoined subject

(WNP-1 (m (a 0)))            &larr; silent wh- antecedent

(NP-SBJ (m (a *T*-1)))       &larr; trace
</pre> </blockquote>

<a name="lemma">
<a name="headword">
<a name="oedid">
<h4>LEMMA</h4>

LEMMA (or "l") contains information about a word's lemma.

<h4>HEADWORD</h4>

Each LEMMA node immediately dominates exactly one HEADWORD (or "h") node
with the relevant lemma spelling.  As a general rule, this is the
spelling of the OED headword.  In the absence of an OED headword, the
spelling is copied from ORTHO, or other guidelines apply (notably, in
the case of <a href="lemmatization-contents.html#number_words">number words</a>).

<h4>OEDID</h4>

Each LEMMA node also immediately dominates an OEDID node, which contain
the Oxford English Dictionary ID for the headword.  (In cases of
homography, there may be several OEDID nodes, each with their own ID.)
These IDs can be added to the end of a URL like the following to access
the lexical entry in the online OED.  Details are discussed below.

<blockquote> <pre>
http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/
http://proxy.library.upenn.edu:2817/view/Entry/
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
There are four OEDID types, which are usefully thought of as being
arranged on a scale:

<a name="id_standard">
<ul>
<li>standard ID

<blockquote> <pre>
(D (o a)
   (m (l (h a) (OEDID 4))))
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
Lexical entries in the online OED can be accessed by the OEDID as it stands.

<blockquote> <pre>
.../view/Entry/4
</pre> </blockquote>

<a name="id_derived">
<p>
<li>derived ID

<p>
In this case, HEADWORD references a subentry in the OED rather than a
main entry.

<blockquote> <pre>
(N (o Forge-Water)
   (m (l (h forge-water) (OEDID d73304))))
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
In some cases, the derived OED headword consists of several orthographic
words.  We join these into a single orthographic word with underscores,
following our general conventions on <a href="lemmatization-contents.html#join_split">joining words</a>.

<p>
The most convenient way of accessing the lexical entry in the online OED
is by searching for the ORTHO form.  This takes you to the relevant main
entry and jumps directly to the relevant subentry.  Alternatively (and a
step less conveniently, you can search for the word via the OEDID
without the leading "d".  This takes you to the top of the page for the
main entry (here, "forge").  You then need to manually scroll down to
the relevant headword.

<blockquote> <pre>
.../view/Entry/73304
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
<a name="id_cna">
<li>cNA
	
<p>
This label is used for compounds that have no entry for the entire compound,
but have entries for at least some of the individual elements.

<blockquote> <pre>
(N+N (o coral-rock)
     (m (l (h coral-rock) (OEDID cNA))))
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
In these cases, users will need to track down the OED entries on their own.
<p>

<a name="id_na">
<li>NA

<p>
Some words have no OED entry whatsoever.  In particular, the OED does
not list proper nouns as such (<i>London</i>), though it does list
compounds containing them (<i>London fog</i>).
See <a href="lemmatization-contents.html#no_lemma">No lemma</a> for details.
</ul>

<a name="plustag">
<h4>PLUSTAG</h4>

The current annotation guidelines for the PPCHE allow complex POS tags,
which reflect the etymological origins of morphological complex words.

<blockquote> <pre>
(ADJ+N gentleman)
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
In the future, we aim to replace these so-called plus tags with
appropriate simple tags in order to facilitate searches and the use of
the corpora for computational purposes.  Nevertheless, the plus tags may
be useful for some projects, so we preserve them under the PLUSTAG node.

<blockquote> <pre>
(N (o gentleman)
   (m (l (h gentleman) (OEDID 77673))
         (PLUSTAG ADJ+N)))
</pre> </blockquote>

<a name="guidelines">
<a name="general_principles">
<h4>Lemmatization guidelines</h4>

<h4>General principles</h4>

The OED is our lemma authority.  In other words, we adopt the OED's
decisions concerning lemmatization in all cases, even when alternative
analyses are possible (or even preferred).  In particular, the POS tag
FW (foreign word) is restricted to words without an OED entry.  However,
the OED is not our authority for POS tags in general.  For instance, we
continue to treat subordinating conjunctions as P or <i>much</i> as a
quantifier (Q) rather than as an adverb (ADV).

<p>
The two guiding principles for our lemmatization are:

<ul>
<li>to associate the word with an OEDID type as high as possible 
    on the scale of OEDIDs (standard &gt; derived &gt; cNA &gt; NA)
<li>to respect the original orthography of the text 
</ul>

<p> Cases of conflict between these principles are resolved by adjusting
orthographic word boundaries - that is, by <a href="lemmatization-contents.html#join_split">joining
or splitting</a> orthographic words.  Joining is indicated by "_"
(underscore), and splitting by "@" (at sign).  By default, splits occur
after hyphens (rather than before).  For examples, see the discussion
below.

<p> Number words are a systematic exception to both principles and are
discussed <a href="lemmatization-contents.html#number_words">separately</a>.

<p> As just mentioned, we generally respect the orthography of the text.
In particular, cases (especially in earlier stages of English) that are
(in principle) ambiguous between a phrasal and a compound word analysis
are handled as they are spelled.  For instance, a two-word sequence
like <i>gentle man</i> is not joined, regardless of meaning.

<blockquote> <pre>
(NP (ADJ (o gentle)                            &larr; phrase
         (m (l (h gentle) (OEDID 77666))))
    (N (o man)
       (m (l (h man) (OEDID 113198)))))

(N (o gentle_man)                              &larr; compound noun
   (m (l (h gentleman) (OEDID 77673))))
</pre> </blockquote>

<p> When compound words lack a main OED entry, but are listed as
derived forms, they receive a <a href="lemmatization-contents.html#id_derived">derived OEDID</a>
(derived ID outranks NA).

<p> 
Compounds without a main or derived entry still receive 
a derived <a href="lemmatization-contents.html#id_derived">OEDID</a> if:

<ul> 
<li>the word contains an element listed by the OED as a productive affix
    or combining form (for example, <i>ill-</i>)

<blockquote> <pre>
(ADJ (o ill-favoured)
     (l (h ill-favoured) (OEDID d91348)))
</pre> </blockquote>

<li>the word is what the OED calls a parasynthetic compound (a word
    formed by both compounding and derivation, where the morpheme
    associated with derivation takes scope over the compound, as
    in <i>hazel-haired</i>).  The word's status as a parasynthetic
    compound may be listed explicitly in the OED, but if not, it will
    generally be clear from an extended list of compounds at the end of
    the OED entry.

<blockquote> <pre>
(ADJ (o hazel-haired)
     (l (h hazel-haired) (OEDID d84871))))
</pre> </blockquote>

<p> In assigning a derived OEID in these cases, the OEDID of the first
element takes precedence over later ones.  In other
words, <i>ill-favoured</i> and <i>hazel-haired</i> get their OEDIDs from
<i>ill-</i> and <i>hazel</i> rather than from <i>favoured</i>
and <i>haired</i>.

</ul>

<a name="join_split">
<h4>Joining and splitting</h4>

As mentioned above, the two lemmatization principles sometimes come in
conflict, in which case the word boundaries of the original text are
adjusted, whether by joining or splitting.  Joining is frequent in
connection with abbreviations and expressions from Latin (<i>a. m.,</i>
<i>P. S.,</i> <i>p. m.,</i> <i>per annum,</i> <i>per cent,</i> and so
on), where at least some of the individual parts have no OED entry, but
the joined word does.

<blockquote> <pre>
(ADV (o per_Annum)                              &larr; this way
     (m (l (h per_annum) (OEDID 236980))))

(P (o per)
   (m (l (h per) (OEDID 237088)
(FW (o Annum)
    (m (l (h Annum) (OEDID NA))))               &larr; not this way
</pre> </blockquote>

<p> 
Conversely, orthographic words without an OED entry are split and treated
as phrases, if that is possible.

<blockquote> <pre>
(ADJP (Q (o little-@)                           &larr; this way
         (m (l (h little) (OEDID 109250))))
      (VAN (o @heard)
           (m (l (h hear) (OEDID85048)))))

(ADJ (o little-heard)
     (m (l (h little-heard) (OEDID NA))))       &larr; not this way
</pre> </blockquote>

<a name="special_cases">
<h4>Special cases</h4>

<a name="number_words">
<h4>Number words</h4>

For present purposes, number words include:

<ul>
<li>ordinary cardinal number words when tagged as NUM (rather than as N
or NS, as is possible <a href="../pos-misc.html#cardinal_numbers"
target="_new">in certain contexts</a>)
<li>"honorary" number words like DOZEN and SCORE when tagged as NUM
<li>ordinal numbers except the suppletive or irregular forms FIRST, SECOND, and THIRD
<li>adverbs derived from ordinal numbers (again, excepting FIRSTLY, SECONDLY, and THIRDLY)
</ul>

The following words do not count as number words for present purposes,
even though they are sometimes or always as tagged as NUM:

<ul>
<li>HALF (but see <a href="lemmatization-contents.html#half">below</a>), ONCE, TWICE, THRICE
</ul>

<p>
As already mentioned, number words are a systematic exception to both of
our lemmatization principles.  Their OEDID is NA, but unlike other
expressions without an OEDID, their ORTHO form is not copied over to
HEADWORD.  Rather, their headword is the numeric value (possibly a
decimal fraction) represented by the NUM word.

<blockquote> <pre>
(NUM (o 25)
     (m (l (h 25) (OEDID NA))))

(NUM (o 20.5)
     (m (l (h 20.5) (OEDID NA)))

(NUM (o twenty-five)
     (m (l (h 25) (OEDID NA))))

(NUM (o XXV)
     (m (l (h 25) (OEDID NA))))

(NUM (o iii=xx=)                           &larr; corresponding to THREESCORE
     (m (l (h 60) (OEDID NA))))
</pre> </blockquote>

The headword for ordinal numbers ends with an invariant ordinal suffix
"th" (in this, by the way, we follow the usage of some of the texts).
The headword for adverbs derived from ordinal numbers ends with
invariant "thly".

<blockquote> <pre>
(ADJ (o fourth)
     (m (l (h 4th) (OEDID NA)))) 

(ADJ (o vi=th=)
     (m (l (h 6th) (OEDID NA)))) 

(ADJ (o 23rd)
     (m (l (h 23th) (OEDID NA)))) 

(ADV (o sixthly)
     (m (l (h 6thly) (OEDID NA)))) 
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
<a href="../pos-misc.html#cardinal_form_with_ordinal_function">Numbers
with cardinal form but ordinal function</a> are tagged by form as NUM
but lemmatized by function with "th".

<blockquote> <pre>
(NP (D (o the)
       (m (l (h the) (OEDID 200211))))
    (NUM (o twenty)
         (m (l (h 20th) (OEDID NA))))
    (N (o day)
       (m (l (l day) (OEDID 47522))))))
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
If necessary, sequences of orthographic words representing numbers are
joined into a single orthographic word.  AND regularly forms part of
such complex number words, and punctuation does so in rare cases like
the last example below.

<blockquote> <pre>
(NUM (o five_and_twenty)
     (m (l (h 25) (OEDID NA))))

(NUM (o one_hundred)
     (m (l (h 100) (OEDID NA))))

(NUM (o four_millions_,_three_hundred_twenty_thousand_five_hundred_and_sixty-eight)    &larr; see <a href="../pos-misc.html#cardinal_numbers" target="_new">Cardinal numbers</a> for the treatment of MILLIONS as NUM
     (m (l (h 4,320,568) (OEDID NA))))

(NUM (o 1_1$$4)
     (m (l (h 1.25) (OEDID NA)))

(ADJ (o Nine_and_Twentieth)
     (m (l (h 29th) (OEDID NA))) 
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
When tagged as NUM, DOZEN and SCORE are treated like other cardinal
numbers.  Users interested in the variation between, say, FOURSCORE and
EIGHTY will need to retrieve examples of interest with reference to the
NUM POS tag and appropriate ORTHO forms rather than directly by
HEADWORD.

<blockquote> <pre>
(NUM (o threescore)
     (m (l (h 60) (OEDID NA))))

(NUM (o fourscore_and_seven)
     (m (l (h 87) (OEDID NA))))

(NUM (o two_dozen)
     (m (l (h 24) (OEDID NA))))
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
When A(N) precedes a number word, it is always joined.

<blockquote> <pre>
(NUM (o a_hundred)
     (m (l (h 100) (OEDID NA))))

(NUM (o a_dozen)
     (m (l (h 12) (OEDID NA))))

(NUM (o a_two)                          &larr; formed by analogy to the above
     (m (l (h 12) (OEDID NA))))
</pre> </blockquote>

<a name="half">
<p>
Although bare HALF does not count as a number word for present purposes,
complex number expressions beginning with HALF A do count as number
words.  Such expressions are lemmatized according to whether they have
an OED entry.  HALF A DOZEN is joined and lemmatized as a unit, whereas
HALF A HUNDRED, HALF A MILLION, etc. are not.

<blockquote> <pre>
(NP (NUM (o half_a_dozen)                         &larr; joined, without NUMP
         (m (l (h 6) (OEDID NA)))))

(NP (NUMP (Q (o half)                             &larr; not joined, with NUMP
             (m (l (h half) (OEDID 83400))))
          (NUM (o a_hundred)
               (m (l (h 100) (OEDID NA))))))
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
In cases of gapping like <i>forty or fifty_thousand</i>, the headword
reflects the intended meaning, not the ORTHO form.

<blockquote> <pre>
(NUMP (NUM (o forty)
           (m (l (h 40,000) (OEDID NA))))         &larr; 40,000, not 40
      (CONJ (o or)
            (m (l (h or) (OEDID 132129))))
      (NUM (o fifty_thousand)
           (m (l (h 50,000) (OEDID NA)))))
</pre> </blockquote>

<p>
Hours and minutes in expressions of clock time are split since the
numbers count different of units of time, and analogously in comparable
cases (degrees, minutes, seconds; pounds, shillings, pence).

For instance, the unlemmatized expression <i>10.30</i> becomes:

<blockquote> <pre>
(NUMP (NUM (o 10)
           (m (l (h 10) (OEDID NA))))
     (PUNC .)
     (NUM (o 30)
          (m (l (h 30) (OEDID NA)))))
</pre> </blockquote>

<a name="no_lemma">
<h4>No lemma</h4>

As mentioned earlier, the OED (generally) has no main entries for proper
nouns, so words tagged as NPR (and its variants NPR$, NPRS, and NPRS$)
lack lemma information.  Since FW is defined in terms of lacking an OED
headword, words tagged as FW lack lemma information as well) and this is
also often true of words tagged as X. In these cases, the material from
ORTHO is copied into HEADWORD, and the value for OEDID is NA.

<a name="fixed_lemma">
<h4>Fixed lemma</h4>

The following POS tags determine the lemma of the associated word.

<li>Departicipial adjectives

<p> Departicipial adjectives are identical in form to past or present
participles, but they function as adjectives (whether nomimal modifiers
or as predicate adjectives).  According to the current annotation
guidelines for the PPCHE, they are tagged by form as verbs (even when
they project ADJP).

<blockquote> <pre>
(NP (D a)
    (DAN done)
    (N deal))

(NP (D a)
    (ADJP (ADV very)
    	  (VAG interesting))
    (N idea))

( (IP-MAT (NP-SBJ (D That)
                  (N idea))
          (VBP sounds)
          (ADJP (VAG interesting))
          (. .)))
</pre> </blockquote>

<p> In order to maximize consistency with the OED's lemmatization
decisions, we plan to replace the verbal POS tags in these cases by ADJ
in the next release of the PPCHE.  (As mentioned <a
href="lemmatization-contents.html#general_principles">earlier</a>, though, this does not mean that
the OED is our POS tagging authority in general.)

<p> The current (beta) lemmatized version of the PPCMBE2 is inconsistent
in this regard.  Most departicipial adjectives are still treated the old
way, with a POS tag of VAG or VAN in the corpus.  Because of the verbal
POS tag, the associated OED headword is the relevant verb (with an OED
category of "v.").

<blockquote> <pre>
(NP (D (o an)
       (l (h a)
              (OEDID 4)))
    (VAG (o aggravating)			&larr; VAG
         (l (h aggravate)		&larr; headword = v.
	        (OEDID 3920)))			&larr; not 3923
    (N (o idea)
         (l (h idea)
	        (OEDID 90954))))
<pre> </blockquote>

But some departicipial adjectives are already treated the new way, with
a POS tag of ADJ in the corpus and an associated OED headword classified
as "adj."

<blockquote> <pre>
(NP (D (o an)
       (l (h a)
              (OEDID 4)))
    (ADJ (o interesting)			&larr; ADJ
         (l (h interesting)		&larr; headword = adj.
	        (OEDID 97743)))			&larr; not 97736
    (N (o idea)
         (l (h idea)
	        (OEDID 90954))))
<pre> </blockquote>

We have attempted to ensure that all tokens of a particular lemma are
treated consistently.  In other words, all instances of adjectival
<i>aggravating</i> should be annotated the old way, and all instances of
adjectival <i>interesting</i> should be annotated the new way.  We are
certain, however, that inconsistencies remain in this regard as well.
