<p>
<li>
In the PPCME2,
the <a href="syn-const.html#ob1_ob2_with_like_etc">experiencer
argument</a> of LIKE and similar verbs (LACK, NEED, WANT) may be mistagged
as <tt>NP-OB1</tt> rather than <tt>NP-OB2</tt>.

<p>
<li>*** ACCORDING in ACCORDING TO is annotated and lemmatized as <tt>ADJ</tt>,
    whereas CONCERNING, TOUCHING, and others are annotated and lemmatized
    as prepositions (<tt>P</tt>).  AND THAT'S A PROBLEM?

<p>
*** The illustrative examples may be inconsistent with the current
annotation guidelines (reflecting earlier versions of the guidelines
instead).  For example, they may contain complex tags that have been
simplified in the corpus.  In such cases, the guidelines in the text
supersede the examples.

<p>
*** Where is this in the manual?

If their form is possessive, measure phrase modifiers of nouns may be
tagged <tt>NP-POS</tt> rather than <tt>NP-MSR</tt>.

Rethink the default in cases that are ambiguous between extraction and
parenthetical

ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED

Enforce QTP vs. META.  Likely not to be an issue for CEEC.  This is best
done once the files are separated (so that trials and plays can be dealt
with separately or ignored for the moment)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

DONE

Enforced gapping for extraposed conjoined subjects

Quantifiers vs. measure phrases

HALF - N is lemmatized as OED noun; all other POS tags are lemmatized as OED adj

PAST

NEEDS - keep as is (treated differently in Middle English versus later corpora).

EACH IN HIS OWN WAY - the proper analysis is almost certainly gapping
(as the documentation now says), but leaving as is for now.

Removed double function tags on extraposed. NP-COM, NP-PRN at IP level
(function now indicated only on the traces, as usual)

Added NP-POS around single-word resumptive pronouns

      (NP-POS-RSP his)

Reviewed and corrected NP-ADT
